# Hello World :video_game: :computer:

I am **Spencer Rafada**. I am from the Philippines :philippines:. I like to code, play video games, and learn different things.

I started BS Software Engineering in 2015 and that is when I discovered the world of programming. Although I have discovered programming for a long time now, I have not had the passion until I got back from my volunteer mission in 2019. I am currently finishing my degree in Brigham Young University-Idaho and I am expected to graduate by Spring of 2023.

## Web Frameworks

## User Manual

### What is my style
- I am very interested and motivated in learning different knowledge in the field of technology. I’d rather learn these things by myself first to bring confidence and confirmation for myself that I have something to offer to the team.
- I find comfort in planning and structuring how my day would be. I believe that progress is an accumulation of all the efforts and time you spent to work on that progress, daily routine.
- I enjoy spending time together with the family and friends I am close with.
### What do I value
- I value love, family, friendship, and loyalty. I understand that there will be arguments along the way and that is something that should strengthen these bonds.
- I value daily routine and repetition.
- I value learning and progression. There is always room to grow ourselves and progress.
### Best Time to Approach Me
- I am not a morning person. I love to spend some time for myself in the morning whether it be a few minutes to an hour, it really depends on how I felt with my mourning routine.
### How do I like people to communicate with me
- Direct, Honest, and Straightforward. I’d rather take an honest feedback than listening/seeing someone beat around the bush and give you what they think you want to hear.
- Be on the same level as I am. I understand that we cannot gauge the knowledge each person has about a topic. Either go to my level or pull me up by sharing more understanding.
### How I make decisions
- Personal Decisions – I decide based on how much I will progress and my personal needs. (Example: Should I study or play video games?)
- Relationship/Group Decisions – I ask my girlfriend for her opinion first before sharing my opinion. This is a weakness of mine in our relationship. It can be applicable to groups because I tend to give others opportunity to share their ideas and opinions first before I do. After doing so, I decide with the decision where everyone is satisfied. More about satisfying everyone’s desires than what I think should be the best one.
### What do people misunderstand about me
- My resting face. Often times people misunderstand me as a snob and doesn’t care about anything in the world.
### How can people help you
- People can help me by sharing the knowledge they have. It also helps that you show it with an example I can visualize or some documentation I can read on.
- Make sure that you are positive and happy with helping me because I can easily assume that you don’t even want to help me.
